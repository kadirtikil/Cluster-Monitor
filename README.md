# Docker Monitor for K8s cluster

This project contains the Docker monitor for a - to be yet implemented - Kubernetes cluster.
The purpose of this Cluster is to host my own projects, and deploy or take them out.

More information regarding architecture and so on following soon...


#TODO:
- use websockets to send heartbeat, and change elements on event.
- add auth for myself (admin) anyone else is well served by just seeing running containers.
